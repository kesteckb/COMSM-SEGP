## Background and Motivation

- Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system.  

Eating too much sugar can contribute to a variety of negative health conditions. There is currently a lack of awareness surrounding sugar content in various foods, and this web app aims to tackle that issue. It would be targeted at people of all ages and offers a playful yet educational experience. 

We will accomplish this by making a game where players will need to feed a hobbit throughout their day with seven different meals. The player will be presented with a selection of various foods and gets points by selecting the item with the least sugar. Each stage of the quiz will represent a different ‘hobbit’ meal (list below). Food items for each stage will be randomized from a pool of potential items, allowing for differing experiences for each playthrough. After selecting a food item, the items will show the corresponding amounts of sugar in sugar-cube form. The user will need to make it through this day without consuming more than the recommended amount (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health), thus learning about the nutritional value of foods they consume regularly. Players would be able to share their results with their friends and family. Health data will be retrieved using nutritional APIs, such as Food Repo, BonAPI, CalorieNinjas, etc. 

- Project Objectives. The high level goals of the project and the contribution towards solving the problem. A checklist against which the team can evaluate their success.
