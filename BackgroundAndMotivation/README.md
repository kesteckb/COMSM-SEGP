### Overview of the problem

NHS guidelines [1] state that adults should limit their sugar intake to 30 grams per day, while children aged 7 to 10 should have no more than 24 grams, and children aged 4 to 6 just 19 grams. In the UK, however, all of these demographics consume more than their recommended daily allowance. According to the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) by Public Health England [2], adults consumed on average 57.1 grams per day, and children aged 4 to 10 consumed on average 52.2 grams per day between 2015-2016 â€“ roughly double what they should have. This excess sugar consumption has adverse health effects on the population, as people are at greater risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay [1].
