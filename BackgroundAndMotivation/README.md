## Background and Motivation

### An overview of the problem: background literature

Most adults and children in the UK consume too much sugar, and this poses significant health risks to the population as people are at greater risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay [1]. Table 1 uses data from the NHS [1] and the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) [2] to illustrate exactly how much excess sugar is consumed by people in the UK.

It is clear from the data that:
-	On average, each demographic consumes more than their recommended daily allowance
-	The 11 – 18 age range consume the most excess sugar at roughly 2.2x their allowance
-	All children and young adults consume over double their allowance 
-	Adults consume less excess sugar than other age groups but still a significant amount more than their recommended daily allowance

Additional data from the NDNS shows that sugar consumption has decreased over time, roughly by 14.4% for 11 – 18 year olds and 7.6% for 19 – 64 year olds between 2008 and 2016. At this rate, however, it would take over fifty years for actual consumption levels to match those recommended by the NHS. Given the adverse health effects of excess sugar consumption, this is a serious issue and accelerating the decrease in sugar intake would be greatly beneficial for the health of the population.

### Identifying the problem: academic research

To address this issue, it is crucial to understand why people are consuming excessive amounts of sugar in the first place. [3] highlights that the main sources of sugar in peoples diets are from processed foods such as cereals, confectionary, and non-alcoholic drinks. This is partly because there is a lack of awareness surrounding the sugar content of these foods. Consider [4]: 

-	The authors conduct a survey of over 2000 adults, in which participants are shown images of non-alcoholic drinks and asked to estimate the amount of sugar contained in them
-	Both fruit juices and carbonated drinks contain roughly 26g/250ml of sugar 
-	Participants underestimate the sugar content of fruit juices by 48%
-	Participants overestimate the sugar content carbonated drinks by 12%

Most participants are not aware that both drinks contain similar levels of sugar, and they perceive the juice be a healthier alternative. If people were properly informed about the sugar content of soft drinks and other processed foods, they would likely make healthier choices in the real world when deciding what to consume. So how can we raise awareness about excess sugar consumption and educate people on the quantities of sugar in foods?

### Tackling the problem: industry review

Institutions often influence the behaviour of large groups of people through ‘nudging’. This involves subtly changing one’s choice environment to alter their actions in a predictable way without forbidding any options [5]. Nudging has already been applied to the UK food and drink sector in the form of nutrition labelling [6], where manufacturers are required to list an overview of the macronutrients present in processed food on their packaging. This makes people aware of how much sugar is contained in the food, which enables them to make informed decisions without limiting the options available.

As [7] point out, however, the sugar amounts presented on these labels (often in grams) do not translate into common units such as teaspoons, and therefore individuals struggle to visualise how much sugar they are consuming.
