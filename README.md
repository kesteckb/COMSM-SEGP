Eating too much sugar can contribute to a variety of negative health conditions. There is currently a lack of awareness surrounding sugar content in various foods, and this web app aims to tackle that issue. It would be targeted at people of all ages and offers a playful yet educational experience. 

We will accomplish this by making a game where players will need to feed a hobbit throughout their day with seven different meals. The player will be presented with a selection of various foods and gets points by selecting the item with the least sugar. Each stage of the quiz will represent a different ‘hobbit’ meal. Food items for each stage will be randomized from a pool of potential items, allowing for differing experiences for each playthrough. After selecting a food item, the items will show the corresponding amounts of sugar in sugar-cube form. The user will need to make it through this day without consuming more than the recommended amount (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health), thus learning about the nutritional value of foods they consume regularly. Players would be able to share their results with their friends and family.
