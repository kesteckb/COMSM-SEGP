## Introduction [10] 

- Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system. 
Eating too much sugar can contribute to a variety of negative health conditions. There is currently a lack of awareness surrounding sugar content in various foods, and this web app aims to tackle that issue. It would be targeted at people of all ages and offers a playful yet educational experience.  

We will accomplish this by making a game where players will need to feed a hobbit throughout their day with seven different meals. The player will be presented with a selection of various foods and gets points by selecting the item with the least sugar. Each stage of the quiz will represent a different ‘hobbit’ meal (list below). Food items for each stage will be randomized from a pool of potential items, allowing for differing experiences for each playthrough. After selecting a food item, the items will show the corresponding amounts of sugar in sugar-cube form. The user will need to make it through this day without consuming more than the recommended amount (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health), thus learning about the nutritional value of foods they consume regularly. Players would be able to share their results with their friends and family. Health data will be retrieved using nutritional APIs, such as Food Repo, BonAPI, CalorieNinjas, etc.  

- Project Objectives. The high level goals of the project and the contribution towards solving the problem. A checklist against which the team can evaluate their success. 
- Video. Short (1-2min) demo video to explain your system (think Kickstarter) 

## Background and Motivation [10] 

- Background literature. Academic research review. 
- State of the art survey. Current industry review. 
- Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and challenge of the problem. 

## System Implementation [20] 

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).  
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).  
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API 
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation. 
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above! 
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment. 

## UX Design [15] 

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping) 
- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders. 
- UX approach – design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics) 
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)  
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems. 

## Sprints & Project Management [15] 

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?) 
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!). 
- Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc) 
-  Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout. 

## Evaluation [15] 

-  Details of how you evaluated your designs (techniques used & awareness of their limitations). Description of  techniques suitable for your particular design. A timeline of evaluation of your design.  
-  Unit testing / Functional testing. 
-  User acceptance testing. Evaluation of your design with users – methods undertaken, findings, implications. 

## Conclusion [10] 

- Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc). 
- Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met 
- This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc) 
- Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work. 
- Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
