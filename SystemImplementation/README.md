## System Implementation  

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams)
    - Class diagrams
        - Brief description
        - Advantages and disadvantages of our setup
    - Sequence diagrams and brief description  
        - Brief description
        - Are there any ways we could have improved this with more time?
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
    - Entity relationship diagram (below)
    - Why did we choose this model?
    - What design choices/changes did we make
        - Storing meals in food instead of meals
        - Removing the need of the meal collection
        - Use of arrays in collections

- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
    - How did we use angular?
    - How were the components organization?
    - Why did we decide to do it this way?
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
