## UX Design

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.
- UX approach â€“ design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)  
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.

Our design phase focused on human-centered design. During our ideation process and development phases, we focused on making decisions with our users in mind. During our initial planning stages, we implemented paper prototypes trying to optimize a game that would allow people to play our game with maximum ease and enjoyment.

In our initial design phase we decided that we wanted to create a tool or website that would help raise awareness to consumption of sugar. As we wanted the tool to be educational, we settled on a quiz, trying to get people to guess the amount of sugar in a product. We suspected that guessing the amount of sugar ina product would be difficult without seeing nutritional information and understanding how food can contain deceptive amounts of sugar could improve people's conscientiousness of sugarconsumption. We decided on this idea using creating a grid of game mechanics and problems we would like to address. Then together as a team

During our initial design process we implemented a simple prototype using Google Slides (insert link here). This prototype included quick images and a basic concept for our vision. During this process we placed ourselves in the perspective of a user. What would make me play this game? How can we make the game interesting to users? During this phase,
