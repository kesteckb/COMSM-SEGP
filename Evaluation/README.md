## Evaluation

*  Details of how you evaluated your designs (techniques used & awareness of their limitations). Description of  techniques suitable for your particular design. A timeline of evaluation of your design.  
    * Techniques to evaluate
        * Hypotheses driven --> these have been outlined in the design stage
        * What other methods did we use? Check out Interaction Design  5th edition for extra info
    * Limitations of techniques --> These are in the powerpoint for the HCI evaluation lecture. Reference these in a way that shows we understand, not just copy and pasted.
    * Description of techniques suitable to our design
        * Questionnaires
            * evaluate designs and ideas and get demographic info
            * feasible number of questions
            * How is this suitable to our design?
            * What limitations did this have?
        * Observations
            * Observe a user using the product, but record what you see without leading them
            * Are the products used as intended
            * Used throughout development
            * How is this suitable to our design?
            * What limitations did this have?
        * Interviews
            *  one to one interactions with stakeholders and end users
            *  How is this suitable to our design?
            *  What limitations did this have?
        * Focus Groups
            * group interviews to capture feelings and eperiences
            * We'll skip this one.
        * Ethnography
            * shadowing users or method acting and training to become an end user
            * Get a fine-grained understanding of user context (political, social, etc)
            * We can try this, but it might be difficult.
    * Timeline of evaluation
        * How often and when did we do the above methods?
*  Unit testing / Functional testing.
    * Unit testing
        * What methods did we use for Unit testing?
        * This is how we tested different components.
        * Which components did we test?
        * How did we test them?
        * What could have been better and or what was a limitation of the method we used?  
    * Functional testing 
        * What methods did we use?
        * This is a form of black-box texting.
        * What could have been better or what was a limitation of this method?
*  User acceptance testing. Evaluation of your design with users – methods undertaken, findings, implications.
    * User acceptance testing
        * Different from the user interviews, but the final round of user interviews and verifiying the 
    * Evaluation of design with users
        * Methods
            * Can user interviews go here? We can move that from the design section to here if so, and that is already drafted.
            * We can also do observations for this as well
        * Findings
            * Not just findings, but how did this align with our hypotheses?
            * How did we ask questions that were not leading questions?
            * Check out HCI evaluations PowerPoint on this as well. 
        * Implications
            * Did our methods work?
            * Could we expand from sugar to other types of nutritional information?
            * Can we use this method to raise awareness of quantity of sugar in food items?
