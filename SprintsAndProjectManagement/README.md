## Sprints and Project Management

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)

            - Things we've done between the previous meeting and now
		        - Things we're planning to work on today
		        - Quick designs for integrated development
		        - Questions or topics we'd like to raise
	      - Goals:
            - Assign tasks
            - Make sure task spread is even and fair
            - Raise awareness for what others are working on
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!).
