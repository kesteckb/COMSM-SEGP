## Sprints and Project Management

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!).
- Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc)
-  Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.
