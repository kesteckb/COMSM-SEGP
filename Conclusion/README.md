## Conclusion

- Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).
Our group took an Agile development approach towards our project which was focused around maintaining and building upon a functional codebase. Initially, a git repository was established to support the foundational Angular framework, and a paper prototype was developed in PowerPoint to provide a skeletal framework for the application. After this additional setup and planning was in place, we began holding daily standups. The focus of the standups was for each member of the team to communicate what they had worked on, what roadblocks they were experiencing, and which task they would be working on going forward. This time was used to identify the primary goals for the week, and to determine where each team member could best contribute. Overall, this approach had a positive impact on the project, as without the daily standups team members could have been more inclined to procrastinate on their tasks, and isolate themselves from the group. This process wasn’t without its challenges. A lot of the managerial tasks fell on the person who acted as scrum master. As there were other assignments and classes that people were focusing on, project progress as well as standup attendance would sometimes stop.
- Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met
- This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)
The coronavirus pandemic has certainly had a significant impact on the way groups work together, and their ability to progress towards meeting their project goals. The largest impacts stem from the course being entirely online. Typically, students have been getting to know each other throughout the course, and are all located in Bristol. Groups would be able to meet regularly to work. Those personal relationships don’t get developed when students aren’t meeting each other and working together in person, limiting their ability to communicate and work together remotely. Small roadblocks and technical issues are no longer solved by people you are working around being able to take a quick look and help out, and can become massive time losses as an individual struggles to find a fix themselves. When people are meeting on campus in a computer lab, there is a greater focus on what is to be worked on during that time, and less inclination to be distracted by other coursework or outside distractions. There is also the psychological impact of the lockdowns, where people are not able to participate in social gatherings, or to simply go out and pursue their normal lives. Much is still unknown about the effects of this, but certainly many people struggled with being isolated at home.
- Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.
The primary intention of our product is to bring awareness to the food choices people make. Though we do include the sugar content of the food choices in the game, the goal isn’t to teach people how much sugar certain foods contain. The idea is simply that people are simply more aware of the sugar in their food, and understand that there are negative impacts to their health with too much sugar consumption.
- Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
Though we were able to meet many of the goals we had set out to achieve, there are certainly many aspects which could be further improved. The gameplay elements of our application are very simple, and would benefit from more complexity. Currently, the food items populated in the quiz are limited, and we would like to greatly expand those options. We would also want to further integrate the outside nutrition api, so that there could be much more variability in the options presented to the players. With more time, it would be fun to add more original artwork to the application, as well as some simple animation.
